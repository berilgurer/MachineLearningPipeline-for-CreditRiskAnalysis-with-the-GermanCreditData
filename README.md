# MachineLearningPipeline for CreditRiskAnalysis with the GermanCreditData
  The project aimed to assess credit risk using the German Credit Dataset. Different algorithms like decision trees, logistic regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) were used in the project. The goal was to gain practical experience in machine learning by going through the steps of data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The performance of the algorithms was measured by accuracy, which indicates how well they predicted credit risk. The decision tree algorithm achieved a 77% accuracy, showing that it can be effective in credit risk assessment. Logistic regression also performed well with a 73% accuracy. Also, the KNN algorithm performed sufficiently with a 74% accuracy. In summary, project insights into using classification algorithms for credit risk assessment. The decision tree, logistic regression, and KNN algorithms showed satisfying results in predicting credit risk. Preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning techniques played a crucial role in improving the algorithms' performance.
